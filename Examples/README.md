# Examples for using DWT-toolbox 
Each sub-directory in this directory provides examples for running programs that are related to analyzing positional dependencies under the DWT model. 
Please see the README files in each sub-directory for detailed descriptions. 

In short, this is what you can find in each sub-directory:
*DWT_fitting: Contains examples for fitting a DWT model for a set of observed DNA sequences (using ChIP-seq) and an inital PSWM or WM model. 
*Posterior_of_Dependency: Shows how to calculate the posterior of positional dependency between all pairs of positions within the TF binding sites. 
*TFBS_prediction: Contains examples that show how to run the DWT model for the purpose of TF binding site prediction. 
*diLogo: Provides examples for generating the diLogo, a visualization method for TF binding speicificity under the DWT model.
