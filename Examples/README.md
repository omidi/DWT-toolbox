# Examples for using DWT-toolbox 
Each sub-directory in this directory provides examples for running programs that are related to analyzing TF binding site (TFBS) identification under the DWT model.
Please see the `README` files under each sub-directory for more details.  

In short, this is what you can find in each sub-directory:
* DWT_fitting: Contains examples for fitting a DWT model for a set of observed DNA sequences (using ChIP-seq) and an
initial PSWM model. We are using the PSWM models that are extracted from [SwissRegulon](http://swissregulon.unibas.ch/fcgi/sr/swissregulon). 
* Posterior_of_Dependency: Shows how to calculate the posterior of positional dependency between all pairs of positions
within the TFBSs.
* TFBS_prediction: Contains examples that show how to run the DWT model for the purpose of TFBS identification. 
* diLogo: Provides examples for generating the diLogo, a visualization method for TF binding speicificity under the
DWT model.
