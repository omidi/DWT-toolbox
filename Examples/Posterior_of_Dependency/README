This directory contains DWT flat files as the input parameters for running the positional dependency program. It is ass-
umed that the source code has been properly compiled. For more information see '../../Source/README' and
    '../../manual.txt'.


Input files:
------------
CTCF.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CTCF under the DWT model.

CEBPB.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CEBPB under the DWT model.


Example
---------
It is Assumed that the binary file of the posterior dependency program, called 'positional_dependency_posterior', is pl-
aced at '../../Source/'. To run the program, execute the following command:

../../Source/positional_Dependency_Posterior CTCF.dwt > CTCF.post

Since the output of the program is printed out in the terminal, we are redirecting the output into 'CTCF.post'. Below we
show the first 20 lines of output file:

0       1       0.9671
0       2       0.0089

There are three columns in the output,  first two columns indicate the index of the position in the binding site  (first
position has index 1). The third column denotes the posterior probability of positional dependency between the two pairs
of positions. The number of lines in the output file is N*(N-1)/2, which N is the size of the binding site.  In the case
of CTCF, N=20, hence there are 190 pairs of positions. In the above example, positions (0,1) are dependent with a proba-
bility of 0.9671.


In the same way as for CTCF we can run the program for another DWT flat file, here CEBPB.dwt:

../../Source/positional_Dependency_Posterior CEBPB.dwt > CEBPB.post

where the output file contains 66 pairs of positions (N=12 for CEBPB). Below we are showing the first 20 lines of output
file:

0       1       0.1634
0       2       0.0569

4       6       0.0672
5       6       0.2033
...

According to this calculation, positions (3,4) and (1,2) are highly dependent (with a probability of almost 1.0).
