This directory contains DWT flat files as the input parameters for running the positional dependency program. It is ass-
umed that the source code has been properly compiled. If not, see the '../../Source/README' or '../../manual.txt'.


Input files:
------------
CTCF.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CTCF under the DWT model.

CEBPB.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CEBPB under the DWT model.


Example
---------
It is Assumed that the binary file of the posterior dependency program, called 'positional_dependency_posterior', is pl-
aced at '../../Source/'. To run the program, execute the following command:

../../Source/positional_Dependency_Posterior CTCF.dwt > CTCF.post

output file:
       Since the output of the program is printed out in the terminal, we are redirecting the output into 'CTCF.post'
       file at the current working directory. There are three columns in the output, first two columns indicate the
       index of the position in the binding site (first position has index 1). The third column gives the posterior
       probability of positional dependency between the two pairs of positions. The number of lines in the output file
       is N*(N-1)/2, which N is the size of the binding site. In the case of CTCF, N=20, hence there are 190 pairs of
       positions.


In the same way we can run the program for another DWT flat file, here CEBPB.dwt: 

../../Source/positional_Dependency_Posterior CEBPB.dwt > CEBPB.post

where the output file contains 66 pairs of positions (N=12 for CEBPB).
