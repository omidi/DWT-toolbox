This directory contains input files, parameter file for running the DWT model. It is  assumed that the source  code has
been properly compiled. If not, see the '../../Source/README' or '../../manual.txt'.


Input files:
------------
CTCF.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CTCF under the DWT model.

CEBPB.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CEBPB under the DWT model.

seq.fasta = contains a  number of DNA sequences in FASTA format. Sequences should  not be separated by TAB or new  line
('\n') characters.

CTCF_param = contains the parameter values for running the DWT model. 
CEBPB_param = contains the parameter values for running the DWT model. 


Example 1
---------
It is Assumed that the binary file of the DWT model, called 'DWT_TFBS_prediction', is placed in the Source directory at
'../../Source/'. For running this example, execute the following command:

../../Source/DWT_TFBS_prediction CTCF.dwt seq.fasta CTCF_params

output file:
       CTCF_results.txt: contains the DWT score for each site within the DNA sequences from both strands. This includes
       all sites (from both strands) within the regions, as given by the FASTA file. See '../../manual.txt'
       for information on the output file format.


Example 2
---------
It is Assumed that the binary file of the DWT model, called 'DWT_TFBS_prediction', is placed in the Source directory at
'../../Source/'. For running this example, execute the following command:

../../Source/DWT_TFBS_prediction CEBPB.dwt seq.fasta CEBPB_params

Note that here in the 'CEBPB_params' a uniform background model for the background nucleotide frequency is given.

output file:
       CEBPB_results.txt: contains the DWT score for each site within the DNA sequences from both strands. This includes
       all sites (from both strands) within the regions, as given by the FASTA file.
