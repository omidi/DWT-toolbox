This directory contains input files for generating diLogo and DWT flat files. It is assumed that the Python scripts that
are located at  '../../Source/' are running properly. For more information see '../../manual.txt'.


Input files:
------------
CTCF.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CTCF under the DWT model.

CEBPB.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CEBPB under the DWT model.

CTCF.post = Posterior of dependency between pairs of positions within the binding site of CTCF.

CEBPB.post = Posterior of dependency between pairs of positions within the binding site of CEBPB.

CTCT.alg = A file that contains a set of binding sites for CTCF, where each of the sequences have a weight.


In the following examples, we assumed that the 'diLogo.py' and 'generate_DWT_model.py' are placed in the '../../Source/'
directory.


Example 1
---------
Showing an example of generating a diLogo for CTCF:

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/diLogo.py -i CTCF.dwt -p CTCF.post


output file:
       CTCF.pdf: The diLogo for CTCF in PDF format. Note that two positions are assumed to be dependent if the posterior
       of positional dependency is at minimum 0.9.  This is a default posterior threshold and it can be explicitly given
       by the '-c' option.


Example 2
---------
Showing an example of generating diLogo for CREBP: 

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/diLogo.py -i CEBPB.dwt -p CEBPB.post -c 0.5


output file:
       CEBPB.pdf: The diLogo for CEBPB in PDF format. In this example, unlike Example 1, the minimum posterior of depen-
       dency needs to be 0.5.


Example 3
---------
Generating a DWT flat file from a set of aligned sequences. 

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/generate_DWT_model.py -i CTCF.alg > CTCF.dwt


output file:
       CTCF.dwt: Contains the DWT flat file as generated from the set input sequences. By default, the name of TF in the
       DWT flat file is set to 'TF'. However, the TF name can be specified at the time of running by option -t. Moreover
       sequences in the input file can have an optional weight,  separated by TAB,  otherwise they will receive the same
       weight.
