This directory contains input files for generating diLogo and DWT flat files. It is assumed that the required library and
tools are being installed, for more information see:  '../../manual.txt'


Input files:
------------
CTCF.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CTCF under the DWT model.

CEBPB.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model for CEBPB under the DWT model.

CTCF.post = Posterior of dependency between pairs of positions within the binding site of CTCF.

CEBPB.post = Posterior of dependency between pairs of positions within the binding site of CEBPB.

CTCT.alg = A file that contains a set of binding sites for CTCF, where each of the sequences have a weight.


In the following examples, we assumed that the diLogo.py and generate_DWT_model.py are being located in the Source dire-
ctory located at '../../Source/'.


Example 1
---------
Showing an example of generating diLogo for CTCF:

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/diLogo.py -i CTCF.dwt -p CTCF.post


output file:
       CTCF.pdf: The diLogo for CTCF in PDF format. Note that by default, positions are taken as dependent if they have
       at least a posterior of dependeny of 0.9.



Example 1
---------
Showing an example of generating diLogo for CREBP: 

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/diLogo.py -i CEBPB.dwt -p CEBPB.post -c 0.5


output file:
       CEBPB.pdf: The diLogo for CEBPB in PDF format. In this example, unlike Example 1, the minimum posterior of dep-
       endency needs to be 0.5. Therefore, that would lead to a higher number of identified dependencies.



Example 3
---------
Generating a DWT flat file from a set of aligned sequences. 

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/generate_DWT_model.py -i CTCF.alg > CTCF.dwt


output file:
       CTCF.dwt: Contains the DWT flat file as generated from the set input sequences. By default the name of TF in the
       DWT flat file is set to 'TF'. However, this can be specified at the time of running by option -t. See the next
       example.



Example 4
---------
Generating a DWT flat file from a set of aligned sequences. 

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/generate_DWT_model.py -i CTCF.alg -t CTCF > CTCF.dwt


output file:
       CTCF.dwt: Contains the DWT flat file as generated from the set input sequences. In this example, the DWT flat
       file has 'CTCF' as the TF name in the first line.
