This directory contains input files, parameter file for running the program responsible for fitting the DWT model. It is
assumed that the dependencies are compiled as reside in their directories, as well as Python scripts are running. For m-
ore information, see the ''../../manual.txt'' file.


Input files:
------------
CEBPB.wm =  Position-specific weight matrix (PSWM) file for CEBPB.

CEBPB.fasta = A set of DNA sequences that are provided in the FASTA format.  These sequences have been obtained from the
              ENCODE ChIP-seq experiment for CEBPB. This WM is obtained from the SwissRegulon database.

BHLHE.wm = A PSWM file for BHLHE. The PSWM file is obtained from the SwissRegulon database.

BHLHE.fasta = A set of DNA sequences that are provided in the FASTA format.  These sequences have been obtained from the
              ENCODE ChIP-seq experiment for BHLHE.


Example 1
---------
It is supposed that the Python script fitting_DWT_model.py is placed in the Source directory, located at:
'../../Source/'. For running this example, execute the following command:

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/fitting_DWT_model.py -w CEBPB.wm -f CEBPB.fasta -o CEBPB -t CEBPB -b -v

Note that, any other path for Python can be replaced instead of /usr/local/bin/python. The above example, runs the prog-
ram for a set of FASTA sequences that are stored in the CEBPB.fasta file, and uses an initial PSWM model which is  given
by CEBPB.wm. The output of the  program is stored in a directory which is called CEBPB. As specified by using the option
-b, we  are using a random  background model  for nucleotide frequencies that is fitted to the input DNA sequences. This
background nucleotide model is used for calculating the  PSWM and DWT scores. The name  of the TF is explicitly given by
the -t option, even though that is an optional parameter. Finally, we are running the program in the verbose mode as sp-
ecified by the -v option). Upon running the above command, following output should appear on the screen:

First line shows how many TF binding sites (TFBSs) are being identified after using the input PSWM model. Since the min-
imum posterior parameter is not given,  it is assumed by default a minimum posterior of 0.5. Following that, a DWT model
is built on the selected TFBSs,  and it is used for identifying new TFBSs. In the second round a set containing 271 TFBS
were identified. We are comparing the dinucleotide frequency matrix of the two consequent rounds as a measure for conve-
rgence. The iteration is converged if the distance between the two dinucleotide matrices are smaller than 0.05. This pr-
ocedure continues iteratively  until 11th iteration where the distance is 0.005919 (below <0.05). At the final iteration
286 TFBS were identified and stored in the CEBPB.alg in the CEBPB directory.


output files are stored in CEBPB directory as includes:
    CEBPB.dwt: Storing the fitted DWT model for CEBPB.
    CEBPB.alg: Set of 134 identified TFBSs. At each line a TFBS and its posterior probability.
    CEBPB.pdf: diLogo plot for the final DWT model.
    CEBPB.post: Posterior probability of positional dependency between all pairs of positions.
    intermediate_results: This directory contains intermediate files that were produced while running the program, incl-
    uding DWT models and identified TFBSs at each round of iteration.


Example 2
---------
It is supposed that the Python script fitting_DWT_model.py is placed in the Source directory, located at:
'../../Source/'. For running this example, execute the following command:

/usr/local/bin/python ../../Source/fitting_DWT_model.py -w BHLHE.wm -f BHLHE.fasta -o BHLHE -p 0.3 -v

In this example, we run the program for a set of FASTA sequences that are stored in the BHLHE.fasta file, and use an in-
itial PSWM model given by BHLHE.wm. The output of the program is stored in a directory which is called BHLHE. Here we a-
re explicitly specified 0.3 as the minimum posterior (option -p)  for selecting TFBSs.  Since we did not use  option -b,
background nucleotide frequency is set to a uniform distribution for all bases. Finally,  we are running the  program in
verbose mode (-v option). Upon running the above command, following output should appear on the screen:


number of identified TFBS in iteration 1 is 1231
*****************************
difference at round 2 is 0.920669
number of identified TFBS in this iteration is 1978
*****************************
difference at round 3 is 0.257377
number of identified TFBS in this iteration is 2235
*****************************
difference at round 4 is 0.072601
number of identified TFBS in this iteration is 2394
*****************************
difference at round 5 is 0.027908
number of identified TFBS in this iteration is 2579
*****************************


The output log shows the number of the predicted TFBSs at each iteration of the fitting.  In addition,  it shows that at
each iteration the distance of a dinucleotide matrix from the currently predicted TFBSs and the previous set. Upon conv-
ergence (distance < 0.05), the program stops and the results will be stored in BHLHE directory. In final round, the pro-
gram predicted 2579 TFBSs.

output files in BHLHE directory:
    BHLHE.dwt: DWT flat file for BHLHE.
    BHLHE.alg: Set of 3268 identified TFBSs. At each line a TFBS and its posterior probability.
    BHLHE.pdf: diLogo plot for the final DWT model.
    BHLHE.post: Posterior probability of positional dependency between all pairs of positions.
    intermediate_results: This directory contains intermediate files that were produced while
                          running the program, including DWT models and identified TFBSs at
                          each iterations.
