This folder contains two source codes in C++ and Python scripts useful for TF binding site prediction and other 
analysis. The programs are:
1) DWT_model: A C++ code that performs TFBS prediction over FASTA sequences when a DWT model object is given.
2) Positional_Dependency_Posterior: Provided a DWT model object it determines the posterior of pairwise dependencies 
between all pair of binding positions.
3) diLogo: Is a Python script that draws a diLogo in PDF format for a DWT model object.
4) generate_DWT_model: Providing a set of binding sites, it generates a DWT model object useful for the rest of the analysis. 
This code resides in the same directory as diLogo. 

In addition to the above code, we developed a website that by providing a set of sequences in FASTA format and an initial motif (a normal weight matrix) performs the Pairwise Dependency analysis and provides a DWT model object. 

In the C++ codes we have used the boost library. Specifically, we have used the string functions and lgamma which calculates the logarithm of the gamma function. 
In diLogo we have used the pyx library in python that is useful for making 2D graphics. In addition, we have used the argparse library in both diLogo.py and generate_DWT_model.py scripts. 
For diLogo, there is an optional argument which is the cutoff over the posteriors. By default it is set to 0.9. But based on the application the users can change it by -c option. In generate_DWT_model the name of the TF is an optional argument. If not provided, in the resulted DWT model file the name of TF will be set to 'TF' by default.
