This directory contains DWT flat files as the input parameters for runnning the 
positional dependency program. 
It is assumed that the source code has been properly compiled. If not, see the 
'../Source/README' or '../manual.txt'. 


Input files:
------------
CTCF.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model of CTCF 
under the DWT model. 

CEBPB.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model of CEBPB 
under the DWT model. 


Example
---------
It is Assumed that the binary file of the posterior dependency program, called 
'positional_dependency_posterior', is placed at the current working directory. 
To run the program simply run: 

./positional_dependency_posterior CTCF.dwt > CTCF.post

output file:
       Since the output of the program is printed out in the consule, we have redirected
       the output into 'CTCF.post' file at the current working directory. 
       There are three columns in the output, first two columns contains the index of the
       position in the binding site (first position has index 1). The third column gives
       the posterior probability of positional dependency between the two pairs of positions. 
       The number of lines in the output file is N*(N-1)/2, which N is the size of the 
       binding site. In the case of CTCF, N=20, hence there are 190 pairs of positions. 


In the same way we can run the program for another DWT flat file, here CEBPB.dwt: 

./positional_dependency_posterior CEBPB.dwt > CEBPB.post 

where the output file contains 66 pairs of positions (N=12 for CEBPB).
