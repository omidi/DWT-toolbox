This directory contains the DWT model source code for finding TFBS within DNA FASTA file. 
See the '../Examples' directory and '../manual.txt' file for how to run the program. 


Prerequisite:
	The program uses some functions from the Boost library. We have put a version of the Boost
	library in '../../lib/boost_1_41_0'. The library is compressed, so first it is required to 
	uncompress the library. For that, go to '../../lib/boost_1_41_0' and run:

	tar -xvf boost_1_41_0.tar.gz

	NOTE: if the Boost library is already uncompressed, this step is not necessary. 



Compiling: 
	Under Linux one simply has to type 'make' in this directory to compile
	the code. This should produce an executable file, which is called:
	DWT_TFBS_prediction



Final note:
      This should probably also work under MACOS. Under windows you will
      need to know how to compile C and C++ source-code in order to get
      DWT_TFBS_prediction to run. Note, the code uses only standard libraries 
      as far as we are aware. We use the GNU C++ compiler (g++) to compile the 
      code. If you have another C++ compiler, please replace the corresponding 
      commands in the MakeFile.
