This directory contains input files, parameter file for running the DWT model. 
It is assumed that the source code has been properly compiled. If not, see 
the '../Source/README' or '../manual.txt'.


Input files:
------------
CTCF.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model of CTCF 
under the DWT model. 

CEBPB.dwt = DWT flat file that contains the binding specificity model of CEBPB 
under the DWT model. 

seq.fasta = contains a number of DNA sequences in FASTA format. Sequences should 
not be separated by TAB or new line ('\n') characters. 

CTCF_param = contains the parameter values for running the DWT model. 
CEBPB_param = contains the parameter values for running the DWT model. 


Example 1
---------
It is Assumed that the binary file of the DWT model, called 'DWT_TFBS_prediction', is 
placed at the current working directory, we can run the program as bellow: 

./DWT_TFBS_prediction CTCF.dwt seq.fasta CTCF_params

output file:
       CTCF_results.txt: contains the DWT score for each site within the DNA sequences 
       from both strands. This includes all sites (from both strands) within the regions, 
       as given by the FASTA file. See '../manual.txt' for information on the output file
       format. 


Example 2
---------
It is assumed that the binary file of the DWT model, called 'DWT_TFBS_prediction', is 
placed at the current working directory, we can run the program as bellow: 

./DWT_TFBS_prediction CEBPB.dwt seq.fasta CEBPB_params

Note that here in the 'CEBPB_params' a uniform background model for the background nucleotide
frequency is given.

output file:
       CEBPB_results.txt: contains the DWT score for each site within the DNA sequences 
       from both strands. This includes all sites (from both strands) within the regions, 
       as given by the FASTA file. See '../manual.txt' for information on the output file
       format.
