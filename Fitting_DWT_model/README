This is the code for fitting a DWT model to a set of DNA sequences.

Provided are source-code, a manual, several examples of the program's usage.


CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY:

fitting_DWT_model.py -> A Python implementation for fitting a DWT model to a
                        set of DNA sequences, given an initial PSWM (or WM)
                        model.

Examples -> Directory with several examples to run the program.

manual.txt -> A description of the program usage and input arguments.

libs -> Contains MotEvo source code and executable. MotEvo is a program for
        identifying TFBS. In general, MotEvo can use phylogenetic information
        over a multiple alignments. However, here we are using it in a normal
        single species mode.


There are README files in each subdirectory to help you further. We suggest
you first check out the manual.txt file, which explains how to run the prog-
ram.
