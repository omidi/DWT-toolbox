This directory contains the MotEvo source code.
motevo.c = The MotEvo source code.

runUFE.cpp
evomodel.cpp
evomodel.h = Source code for the UFE-file creation.

Under Linux one simply has to type 'make' in this directory to compile
the code. This should produce two executables:
motevo
runUFE

This should probably also work under MACOS. Under windows you will
need to know how to compile C and C++ source-code in order to get
MotEvo to run. Note, the code uses only standard libraries as far as we are
aware. We use the GNU C++ compiler (g++) to compile the code. If you
have another C++ compiler, please replace the corresponding commands
in the MakeFile.
